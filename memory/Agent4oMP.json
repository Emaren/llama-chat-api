\n- Can be used to **spawn new autonomous agents** with deterministic inheritance, signing lineage, and cross-agent interface contracts  \n\nThis allows any outside developer or agent to:\n\n- Verify that two agents **originated from the same logical base**  \n- Check for divergence or mutation in inherited logic over time  \n- Fork, evolve or audit agents **without permission or runtime
